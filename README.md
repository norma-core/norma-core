### The Unified Toolkit for Physical System Development & Operations

**NormaCore** is a unified toolkit designed to facilitate the development and deployment of physical systems. From complex robotics to distributed sensor networks and hobby projects, the system provides a solid foundation to manage them all. To achieve this goal, the platform combines a unified API, high-performance data pipelines, and visual tooling to help you build and manage your entire ecosystem as one.

**Developer experience sits at the heart of our design philosophy.**

To fully realize the potential of this approach, we had to build a lot from scratch, rethinking traditional solutions from a practical perspective. This includes not just software, but complete hardware systems like our **7+1 DoF robotic arm** with a **parallel jaw gripper** - tools designed to open up a whole new dimension of applications for home and research robotics without significant cost or investment.

While we continue polishing the full arm, we’re kicking off our open‑source release cycle with the **Parallel Jaw Gripper**.
