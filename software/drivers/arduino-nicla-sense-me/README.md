# Arduino Nicla Sense ME driver

Station driver for the [Arduino Nicla Sense ME](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nicla-sense-me)
(BHI260AP IMU, BMM150 magnetometer, BMP390 barometer, BME688 gas sensor) running the
[norma-core firmware](../../../device-support/arduino-nicla-sense-me). Boards are
attached over USB; the driver discovers every one automatically and streams each
board's full 124-byte register snapshot (firmware revision 6) into its own queue
at ~100 Hz. Frames of any other length are discarded as malformed, so a board
on older firmware never produces data until it is reflashed.

The register map, wire protocol and flashing instructions live in the
[firmware README](../../../device-support/arduino-nicla-sense-me/README.md).
This document covers the station side: configuration, queues and what the
driver does at runtime.

## Configuration

Add the block under `drivers` in `station.yaml`:

```yaml
drivers:
  arduino-nicla-sense-me:
    enabled: true
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Start the driver. Omitting the whole block also leaves it off. |

That is the entire configuration. There is no port, baud or board list:

- **Boards are autodetected** by USB vendor/product id `2341:0060` (the Nicla's
  SAMD11 USB bridge). Serial ports are re-enumerated every 500 ms, so a board
  plugged in after the station started, or re-plugged under a new path, is
  picked up without a restart.
- **The baud rate is fixed** at 921600 and must match the firmware. It is a real
  UART rate between the bridge and the nRF52, so it bounds throughput; it is a
  constant in the driver, not a config key.
- **Multiple boards** work out of the box; each gets its own worker and queue.

## Reading the data

The driver forwards the firmware's register image untouched in
`RxEnvelope.data`; decoding lives in the consumer
(`station-viewer/src/devices/arduino-nicla-sense-me/values.ts`). The register
map is documented in the firmware README. One field deserves a note because it
is easy to misread.

### Quaternion accuracy (register 0x3C)

The fifth float of the quaternion block (0x2C w, 0x30 x, 0x34 y, 0x38 z,
**0x3C accuracy**) is the sensor hub's own estimate of the rotation vector's
**heading error, in radians**. It comes from the 16-bit accuracy field of the
BHY2 rotation-vector FIFO packet; the Arduino_BHY2 library scales that field by
the same 1/16384 factor it applies to w/x/y/z
(`Arduino_BHY2/src/sensors/DataParser.cpp`, `parseQuaternion`), and the
firmware writes the result as-is.

How to read it:

- **≈ 3.142 (π):** the magnetometer is not calibrated yet. The fusion has no
  usable heading reference, the quaternion sits near identity for a level
  board, and any heading derived from it is meaningless. Tilt (pitch/roll,
  gravity, linear acceleration) is still usable because it comes from the
  accelerometer and gyroscope; on the bench the gravity vector derived from the
  quaternion matched the accelerometer to a few thousandths of a g while the
  accuracy still read π.
- **Dropping well below π:** the hub has locked onto the earth field and the
  heading can be trusted to roughly that many radians. Calibrate by moving the
  board through a figure-eight for a few seconds; the value falls as the
  calibration converges. Once a good heading has been held for 30 s the
  firmware stores the hub's calibration profiles in flash and restores them at
  the next boot (see the firmware README, "Calibration persistence"), so this
  state normally lasts only for the first session.

The viewer shows the value in the history detail panel. The rover HUD shows it
next to the compass as `±N°` and withholds the heading entirely while it reads
≈ π (see `vesc-pwm-output-control/rover-motion.ts`); attitude is still shown,
since only a quaternion whose norm is far from 1 (unpopulated registers) is
rejected. Any other consumer should pick its own threshold; the raw value is
recorded in every frame so that decision can be made, or changed, later.
